If you can type, you can create professional videos—no courses, no tutorials.

### What is Text-Based Video Creation?
Describe your video in plain English. AI creates it professionally.
- You write: "Show my product with energetic music and modern transitions."
- You get: A polished 30-second video ready for Reels, TikTok, Shorts.

### The Process
1. Write your core description (what to show, how it should feel, who it's for).
2. Add specifics (features to highlight, lifestyle context, CTA).
3. Upload assets (logos, product images).
4. Let AI work (~10 minutes).
5. Refine with simple instructions ("Make the opening more dramatic").

### Templates
- Product Launch: "Create exciting product reveal with anticipation and powerful ending."
- Social: "Trendy, fast-paced lifestyle edit of [product] for IG Reels."
- Business Intro: "Professional overview with trustworthy tone and modern style."

### Why Text Wins
- Cost: $20/month vs. thousands in agency fees.
- Speed: 10 minutes vs. 30 hours of production.
- Accessibility: Anyone can do it.

### Real-World Wins
- E-commerce: "Show product from 3 angles with upbeat music" → ready for product page.
- Social: "Trendy lifestyle edit with viral transitions" → publish same day.

Typing is the new editing.`

After analyzing thousands of product videos, clear patterns emerge.

### The Hook That Works
**First 3 seconds determine everything:**
- 73% of viewers decide to keep watching in first 3 seconds
- Problem-solution hooks convert 2.3x better than feature lists
- Movement or transformation gets 67% more engagement

### Optimal Video Structure
**30-Second Formula (Based on Data):**
- 0-3s: Hook with problem or transformation
- 3-12s: Show product solving the problem
- 12-24s: Social proof or lifestyle context
- 24-30s: Clear call-to-action

### Length vs. Conversion
- 15-30 seconds: Highest conversion rates
- 30-60 seconds: Best for complex products
- 60+ seconds: Significant drop-off

### Visual Patterns That Convert
1. **Multiple angles**: +45% conversion
2. **Lifestyle context**: +38% engagement
3. **Before/after**: +52% for problem-solving products
4. **Text overlays**: +23% retention

### Platform Differences
**Instagram Reels**: Trendy, fast-paced
**TikTok**: Authentic, relatable
**YouTube Shorts**: Educational angle
**Facebook**: Emotional connection

The data doesn't lie: structure beats creativity for conversion.`
